# Deployment Guide

## Prerequisites
ssh into the Scheduler VM and paste your private GitHub SSH key to the VM under `~/.ssh/id_rsa`.
- Make sure the key is password protected; if not, you can add a password by running `ssh-keygen -p -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa`.
- Make sure the key has the correct permissions by running `chmod 600 ~/.ssh/id_rsa`.
- Make sure your user on VM is in the "builders" & "docker" groups(Reach out for help)
- Make sure to run `gcloud auth configure-docker us-central1-docker.pkg.dev` on the VM.

```bash
gcloud compute ssh --zone "us-central1-a" "scheduler-zen"
```
This will allow pulling from our private GitHub repository.

## Building the Docker Image
In your terminal, navigate to the root directory of this project and run the following command:
```bash
./scripts/release-deploy/make-deployment.sh
```
This will ssh into the Scheduler VM, pull the latest code, and build and push the Docker image to the GCP artifact registry.

## Deploying the Docker Image to the MIG
In your terminal, navigate to the root directory of this project and run the following command:
```bash
./scripts/release-deploy/deploy-to-mig.sh
```
This will trigger a rolling update on the MIG to replace the current VMs.
New VMs will be created and will run the latest Docker image.

### Monitor the rolling update
To monitor the rolling update, go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/compute/instanceGroups/details/us-central1-a/lumino-ui-{env})

### Deploy a Specific Version
To deploy a specific version of the Docker image, run the following command:
```bash
./scripts/release-deploy/deploy-to-mig.sh <VERSION>
```
example:
```bash
./scripts/release-deploy/deploy-to-mig.sh 0.10.0
```
This will tag the Docker image with the specified version to `latest` and kick off the MIG rolling update.
